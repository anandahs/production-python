"""A simulated third-party FX rate service.

Treat this exactly like a real external API you don't control - read its
behavior by calling it, don't rely on editing it. It's deliberately
flaky in two different ways, on purpose:

- USD/EUR and USD/GBP are temporarily unavailable for their first couple
  of calls, then start working - representing a transient problem
  (think: a timeout, or a 500) that a retry can genuinely fix.
- USD/XXX is not a real currency pair. It will never succeed, no matter
  how many times you call it - representing a permanent problem (think:
  a 400 Bad Request) that no amount of retrying will ever fix.
